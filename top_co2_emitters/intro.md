Here are the historical trends of co2 emissions and excesses of the top emitters of 2019.  The emitters can be viewed as a list of companies, regions, etc.
Note: Excess =  Emission - Utfärdade utsläppsrätter.

While the emissions of the top emitters have not reduced considerably in the last decade, they seem to be have kept under their limits as seem in the lower graph. However, it is not possible for them to continue the current trend if Sweden were to meets its climate goals.
